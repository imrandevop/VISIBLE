# Finish Service Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a new "finish_service" WebSocket message type for both seeker and provider to mark a service as completed, with optional rating functionality for seekers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Updates
**File**: `apps/profiles/work_assignment_models.py`

Added to `WorkSession` model:
- `completed_by` - ForeignKey to track which user marked the service as finished
- `rating_stars` - Integer (1-5) for seeker's rating of provider (optional)
- `rating_description` - TextField for seeker's review text (optional)
- `rated_at` - DateTime timestamp when rating was provided

**Migration**: `profiles/migrations/0015_worksession_completed_by_worksession_rated_at_and_more.py`

### 2. WebSocket Consumer Updates
**File**: `apps/profiles/work_assignment_consumers.py`

#### ProviderWorkConsumer
- Added `handle_finish_service()` method
  - Provider can mark service as finished (without rating)
  - Stops distance updates
  - Closes WebSocket connection
  - Notifies seeker

- Added `service_finished_event()` channel layer handler
  - Receives notification when seeker finishes service
  - Closes WebSocket connection

- Added `complete_session()` database method
  - Marks session as 'completed'
  - Updates work order status to 'completed'
  - Sets chat message expiry (24 hours)
  - Optionally stores rating if provided

- Added `notify_service_finished()` notification method
  - Sends completion notification to other user

#### SeekerWorkConsumer
- Added `handle_finish_service()` method
  - Seeker can mark service as finished with optional rating
  - Validates rating (1-5 stars if provided)
  - Stops distance updates
  - Closes WebSocket connection
  - Notifies provider

- Added `service_finished_event()` channel layer handler
  - Receives notification when provider finishes service
  - Closes WebSocket connection

- Added `complete_session()` database method (same as provider)
- Added `notify_service_finished()` notification method

### 3. Documentation Updates
**File**: `WEBSOCKET_FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md`

- Added new feature description in overview section
- Added message type documentation for both provider and seeker
- Updated WebSocket message type summary tables
- Added implementation details for service completion
- Updated WorkSession model documentation

## Message Formats

### Provider Finish Service
**Request**:
```json
{
    "type": "finish_service",
    "session_id": "uuid-here"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "type": "service_finished",
    "session_id": "uuid-here",
    "message": "Service marked as finished successfully",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Seeker Finish Service (with optional rating)
**Request**:
```json
{
    "type": "finish_service",
    "session_id": "uuid-here",
    "rating_stars": 5,
    "rating_description": "Excellent service, very professional!"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "type": "service_finished",
    "session_id": "uuid-here",
    "message": "Service marked as finished successfully",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Notification to Other User
```json
{
    "type": "service_finished",
    "session_id": "uuid-here",
    "finished_by": "provider",  // or "seeker"
    "message": "Provider marked the service as finished",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-07T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Behavior

### When Service is Marked as Finished:
1. **Session State**: Changes to 'completed'
2. **Work Order**: Status updated to 'completed'
3. **Chat Messages**: Start 24-hour expiry countdown
4. **WebSocket Connections**: Both automatically close
5. **Active/Search Status**: NOT re-enabled (unlike cancellation)
6. **Distance Updates**: Stopped

### Rating System:
- **Who can rate**: Only seeker can rate provider
- **Rating fields**:
  - `rating_stars`: 1-5 (optional)
  - `rating_description`: Text review (optional)
- **Privacy**: Rating is private, not immediately shown to provider
- **Provider limitation**: Provider cannot provide ratings

### First to Finish Wins:
- Either user can mark service as finished
- Whoever marks it first completes the session
- If session already completed, returns error

## Migration Instructions

```bash
# Create migrations (already done)
python manage.py makemigrations profiles

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate profiles

# Verify migrations
python manage.py showmigrations profiles
```

## Testing Examples

### Provider Marks Finished
```javascript
ws_provider.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'finish_service',
    session_id: 'session-uuid'
}));
```

### Seeker Marks Finished with Rating
```javascript
ws_seeker.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'finish_service',
    session_id: 'session-uuid',
    rating_stars: 5,
    rating_description: 'Great service!'
}));
```

### Seeker Marks Finished without Rating
```javascript
ws_seeker.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'finish_service',
    session_id: 'session-uuid'
}));
```

## Error Handling

### Missing session_id
```json
{
    "type": "error",
    "error": "session_id is required"
}
```

### Invalid rating
```json
{
    "type": "error",
    "error": "rating_stars must be an integer between 1 and 5"
}
```

### Session already completed
Returns `success: false` from `complete_session()` method

## Files Modified
1. `apps/profiles/work_assignment_models.py` - Added rating fields to WorkSession
2. `apps/profiles/work_assignment_consumers.py` - Added finish service handlers
3. `WEBSOCKET_FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Updated documentation
4. `apps/profiles/migrations/0015_worksession_completed_by_worksession_rated_at_and_more.py` - New migration

## Next Steps
1. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate profiles`
2. Test the finish service flow with both provider and seeker
3. Verify rating storage in database
4. Test that WebSocket connections close properly
5. Verify chat message expiry is set correctly

## Notes
- Rating is optional for seeker
- Provider cannot provide rating
- Rating is private (not shown to provider immediately)
- Search/active statuses are NOT re-enabled after completion (different from cancellation)
- Both WebSocket connections automatically close after service finished
